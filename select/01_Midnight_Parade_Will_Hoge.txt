Goin down the road to see Miss Anna Lee.
She don't ever seem to mind my absent minded company.
She'll always got that sweet surprise for me
So I think I'll head on up the road.

She got the moonlight seen it when she spreads her wings
She got the rhtytm I can tell when she dances and sings
She comes to me with a sweet and sad refrain
So I think I'll, think I'll take her on up the road.

Pack your bags and won't you come with me
Steal away with you about half past three
Bring my guitar along
Show you a brand new song
Take you far far away
On this midnight parade

Take my hand cause I know that you wanna go
Hear Mrs. Aretha Franklin singing on this AM radio
Let the top down and watch your sweet hair blow
And I think I'll take you on up the road

Pack your bags and won't you come with me
Steal away with you about half past three
Bring my guitar along
Show you a brand new song
Take you far far away
On this midnight parade

Come with me now love
Honey don't you know
Baby won't you,
I got this thing,
I'm just dying to show you love
I just, I just got to let it show
On this midnight parade
On this midnight parade
